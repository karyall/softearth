# SoftEarth

An object-oriented PHP library for managing geographical (earth specific) data.

## Requirements

The SoftEarth PHP library has the following requirements:

* PHP 5.6+

## Installation

For using SoftEarth within your projects we recommend to install it using composer.

```
$ php composer.phar require mnrahimi/softearth
```

## The Idea

The idea behind SoftEarth is that I want to create an object-oriented PHP library for accessing, manipulating and managing geographical data like country, state (province), city and the related properties and attributes like country's currency and all the nested data to each object.<br><br>
SoftEarth will greatly help any application or website project where the app is interacting with some kind of geographical data the most significant example is a registeration behaviour where in most signup or registeration procedures country or some other kind of SoftEarth data is necessary.

## Contribution

Any contribution will be greatly appreciated. Currently there are no specific contribution guidelines ready though **for the sake of contribution you have to go through the project source code**.

Thanks in advance,<br>
Muhammad Nasir Rahimi
